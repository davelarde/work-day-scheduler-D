This homework works as a work day scheduler, where user has access to save whatever plan or task desired. As soon the page opens, it will display on the header the actual date of the day. Below you will be able to find the time block from 8am to 5pm. Most likely business hours.
Color for time blocks will change according to the time, Grey color will stand for past hours, red for current and green for future times available. 
This work day scheduler will storage the data in the local storage. Please inspect it in the console to see the accurate function. 
I have created a clear button on the top left side for user to clear data in case of mistake, or change of plans.

Below you can find a link that will direct you to the gif of demo for this scheduler. Please be aware that if it only shows one color on the time blocks, it might be , because is past the time of time-blocks. In case this happens in the demo folder , you will also find a screenshot with the mentioned colors.
